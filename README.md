# Missing VCRUNTIME140.dll fixing
<img src="https://ugetfix.com/wp-content/uploads/articles/askit/vcruntime140-dll-is-missing-error-windows_en.jpg"/>
We have noticed that PHP Console failed to load because there was a missing .dll file from some user's PC. Here is a guide to help you out.

### Recommendations
If you encountered missing .dll file as shown above, we recommend reinstalling the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 to fix the missing VCRUNTIME140.dll error. It is important to follow official Microsoft guidelines and install the missing files properly, otherwise, you will have to struggle with each corrupted program separately, which you clearly do not want to happen.

### Get .dll File for your PC
If your PC runs on 32-bits download the 32-bits file but if 64-bits, download the 64-bits file. After which, you are good to go.
